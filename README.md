Gophers is a tool for API testing. It covers:
* unit testing of individual endpoints;
* functional testing of broader scenarios;
* load testing with said scenarios.

It also allows one to record requests and responses in a form suitable for documentation,
so examples in said documentation are always up-to-date.

Examples:
 * [Generated API Blueprint](https://rawgit.com/gophergala2016/gophers/master/examples/github-go/github.html)

> Note: For now it's focused on HTTP JSON APIs. Support for other protocols and API types is planned.

Gophers allows one to write test and scenarios in real programming languages.
