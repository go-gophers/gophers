// Package jsons allows sloppy work with JSON structures (objects and arrays).
//
// This package is tailored for usage in tests, specifically for Gophers tool.
// It sacrifices idiomatic approach for brevity and simplicity of usage.
// For example, all methods panic instead of returning error.
//
// Usage of this package in non-testing code is highly unadvisable.
