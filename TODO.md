# For Gopher Gala

* record requests/responses in APIB format
* load testing mode
* Lua bindings
* clean-up, add comments
* better README with animation

# Later

* fuzz testing?
* switch to some testing framework (mostly due to `testing` logging and panic handling)
  * or drop `testing` and make separate tool
